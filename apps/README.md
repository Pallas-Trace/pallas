# Pallas Applications
These are a few applications that can read and analyse Pallas traces.
The basic usage for all of them is
`my_app_name <arguments> my_trace_folder/my_main_file.pallas`
. Note that the main file of a Pallas trace will be called `eztrace_log.pallas` for any trace that's been generated by EZTrace.

## pallas_print
This app can do three main things:
- Print each event stored in the trace, in the order they appear in, across all the threads.
- Print each event stored in the trace, in the order the appear in, *for each thread*.
- Print the structure of the trace, for each thread.

Here's a list of the arguments one can provide:
| Argument | Meaning                                                                                                                      |
|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| -h, -?   | Prints a help menu.                                                                                                          |
| -v       | Verbose / Debug mode.                                                                                                        |
| -T       | Thread per thread mode.                                                                                                      |
| -d       | Show durations.                                                                                                              |
| -t       | Hide timestamps.                                                                                                             |
| -S       | Show the structure of the trace. Only does so thread per thread. Disables loop unrolling and exploring by default.           |
| -u       | Only works in structure mode. Unrolls the loops, meaning each iteration of the sequences inside the loops will be displayed. |
| -e       | Only works in structure mode. Explore the loops, meaning the sequence inside the loop will be explored and shown.            |

We haven't yet enabled support for exploring without unrolling the loops.

## pallas_info
This app prints information concerning every object present in the trace.

## pallas_comm_matrix
This app generated a communication matrix based on the `MPI_Send`.
